	Abstract = {{Boundary effects are caused by incomplete data in the boundary regions when the analysis window gets closer to the edge of a signal. Various extension schemes have been developed to handle the boundaries of finite length signals to reduce the boundary effects. Zero padding, periodic extension, and symmetric extension are some basic extension methods. However, these solutions have drawbacks. In this paper, we consider the problem of handling the boundary effects due to improper extension methods in the wavelet transform for the application of fault diagnosis of rotating machine. An extension algorithm based on curve fitting with properties that make it more suitable for boundary effects reduction is presented. This extension algorithm could preserve the time-varying characteristics of the signals and be effective to reduce distortions appearing at the boundary. Then, an interpolation approach is used in the boundary effects region to further alleviate the distortions. Procedures for realization of these two algorithms and relative issues are presented. Several experimental tests show that the proposed algorithms are efficient to alleviate the boundary effects in comparison to the existing extension methods.}},

We show that, asymptotically, one version of the estimator achieves the exact optimal rates of convergence over a range of Besov classes for global estimation, and attains adaptive minimax rate for estimating functions at a point. In numerical comparisons with various methods, both versions of the estimator perform excellently.}},

Oracle inequalities are derived and serve as guides for the selection of smoothing parameters. Based on an oracle inequality and motivated by the data compression and localization properties of wavelets, an adaptive wavelet estimator for nonparametric regression is proposed and the optimality of the procedure is investigated. We show that the estimator achieves simultaneously three objectives: adaptivity, spatial adaptivity, and computational efficiency. Specifically, it is proved that the estimator attains the exact optimal rates of convergence over a range of Besov classes and the estimator achieves adaptive local minimax rate for estimating functions at a point. The estimator is easy to implement, at the computational cost of O(n). Simulation shows that the estimator has excellent numerical performance relative to more traditional wavelet estimators.

	Abstract = {{Wavelet threshold estimators for data with stationary correlated noise are constructed by applying a level-dependent soft threshold to the coefficients in the wavelet transform. A variety of threshold choices is proposed, including one based on an unbiased estimate of mean-squared error. The practical performance of the method is demonstrated on examples, including data from a neurophysiological context. The theoretical properties of the estimators are investigated by comparing them with an ideal but unattainable `bench-mark', that can be considered in the wavelet context as the risk obtained by ideal spatial adaptivity, and more generally is obtained by the use of an `oracle' that provides information that is not actually available in the data. It is shown that the level-dependent threshold estimator performs well relative to the bench-mark risk, and that its minimax behaviour cannot be improved on in order of magnitude by any other estimator. The wavelet domain structure of both short- and long-range dependent noise is considered, and in both cases it is shown that the estimators have near optimal behaviour simultaneously in a wide range of function classes, adapting automatically to the regularity properties of the underlying model. The proofs of the main results are obtained by considering a more general multivariate normal decision theoretic problem.}},

@article{Morris2006Waveletbased,
	Abstract = {{Increasingly, scientific studies yield functional data, in which the ideal units of observation are curves and the observed data consist of sets of curves that are sampled on a fine grid. We present new methodology that generalizes the linear mixed model to the functional mixed model framework, with model fitting done by using a Bayesian wavelet-based approach. This method is flexible, allowing functions of arbitrary form and the full range of fixed effects structures and between-curve covariance structures that are available in the mixed model framework. It yields nonparametric estimates of the fixed and random-effects functions as well as the various between-curve and within-curve covariance matrices. The functional fixed effects are adaptively regularized as a result of the non-linear shrinkage prior that is imposed on the fixed effects' wavelet coefficients, and the random-effect functions experience a form of adaptive regularization because of the separately estimated variance components for each wavelet coefficient. Because we have posterior samples for all model quantities, we can perform pointwise or joint Bayesian inference or prediction on the quantities of the model. The adaptiveness of the method makes it especially appropriate for modelling irregular functional data that are characterized by numerous local features like peaks.}},

the minimax rate of convergence is derived. We are particularly interested in
the effect of the unknown mean on the estimation of the variance function. Our
results indicate that, contrary to the common practice, it is not desirable to
base the estimator of the variance function on the residuals from an optimal
estimator of the mean when the mean function is not smooth. Instead it is more
desirable to use estimators of the mean with minimal bias. On the other hand,
when the mean function is very smooth, our numerical results show that the
residual-based method performs better, but not substantial better than the
first-order-difference-based estimator. In addition our asymptotic results also
correct the optimal rate claimed in Hall and Carroll [J. Roy. Statist. Soc.

Our main contributions include: 1) a rigorous and robust regularized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum-likelihood estimation of the rate-ratio density parameters directly from the noisy observed Poisson data (counts); 2) extension of the method to work under a multiscale hidden Markov tree model (HMT) which couples the mixture label assignments in consecutive scales, thus modeling interscale coefficient dependencies in the vicinity of image edges; 3) exploration of a 2-D recursive quad-tree image representation, involving Dirichlet-mixture rate-ratio densities, instead of the conventional separable binary-tree image representation involving beta-mixture rate-ratio densities; and 4) a novel multiscale image representation, which we term Poisson-Haar decomposition, that better models the image edge structure, thus yielding improved performance.

factorizations wherein, in analogy to a wavelet decomposition of an L^2

product of conditional densities reflecting information in both the data and
the parameter vector localized in position and scale. The framework is
developed as a set of sufficient conditions for the existence of such
factorizations, formulated in analogy to those underlying a standard
multiresolution analysis for wavelets, and hence can be viewed as a
multiresolution analysis for likelihoods. We then consider the use of these
factorizations in the task of nonparametric, complexity penalized likelihood
estimation. We study the risk properties of certain thresholding and
partitioning estimators, and demonstrate their adaptivity and near-optimality,
in a minimax sense over a broad range of function spaces, based on squared
Hellinger distance as a loss function. In particular, our results provide an

	Abstract = {{Summary.  The paper introduces a framework for non-linear multiscale decompositions of Poisson data that have piecewise smooth intensity curves. The key concept is conditioning on the sum of the observations that are involved in the computation of a given multiscale coefficient. Within this framework, most classical wavelet thresholding schemes for data with additive homoscedastic noise can be used. Any family of wavelet transforms (orthogonal, biorthogonal or second generation) can be incorporated in this framework. Our second contribution is to propose a Bayesian shrinkage approach with an original prior for coefficients of this decomposition. As such, the method combines the advantages of the Haar--Fisz transform with wavelet smoothing and (Bayesian) multiscale likelihood models, with additional benefits, such as extendability towards arbitrary wavelet families. Simulations show an important reduction in average squared error of the output, compared with the present techniques of Anscombe or Fisz variance stabilization or multiscale likelihood modelling.}},

@article{Harmany2011This,
	Abstract = {{The observations in many applications consist of counts of discrete events,
such as photons hitting a detector, which cannot be effectively modeled using
an additive bounded or Gaussian noise model, and instead require a Poisson
noise model. As a result, accurate reconstruction of a spatially or temporally
distributed phenomenon (f*) from Poisson data (y) cannot be effectively
accomplished by minimizing a conventional penalized least-squares objective
function. The problem addressed in this paper is the estimation of f* from y in
an inverse problem setting, where (a) the number of unknowns may potentially be
larger than the number of observations and (b) f* admits a sparse
approximation. The optimization formulation considered in this paper uses a
penalized negative Poisson log-likelihood objective function with nonnegativity
constraints (since Poisson intensities are naturally nonnegative). In
particular, the proposed approach incorporates key ideas of using separable
quadratic approximations to the objective function at each iteration and
penalization terms related to l1 norms of coefficient vectors, total variation
seminorms, and partition-based multiscale estimation methods.}},

As functions well-localized with respect to both time and scale, wavelets are an ideal tool for working with the often sharp, abrupt nature of gamma-ray burst signals. When applied to an idealized signal in a small simulation study and a selection of actual gamma-ray bursts, the TIPSH algorithm is found to be well capable of simultaneously estimating the smooth, uniform background and the pulse-like structure of gamma-ray burst signals.

@article{Stephens038216,
	Abstract = {We introduce a novel Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating False Discovery Rates (FDRs), and estimating effect sizes. Compared with existing approaches to FDR analysis, the method has two key differences. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects being tested is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This "unimodal assumption" (UA), although natural in many contexts, is very different from assumptions usually made in FDR analyses, and yields more accurate inferences than existing methods provided that it holds. The UA also facilitates efficient and robust computation because estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate, and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value, or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates the estimation of actual effect sizes, and our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures we introduce the term "local false sign rate" to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong, and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable, and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.},
